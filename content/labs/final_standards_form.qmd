## Overview

This is the form you will turn in to identify what aspects of your final project you feel demonstrate the learning objectives as described in the course syllabus [standards table](https://adv-r-programming.github.io/Adv-R-Reader/syllabus/#standards). This is your last opportunity to raise your proficiency levels in the course. 






## Standards Request Formatting

To complete this request form, please attend to the following:

1. Update the `author` field in the Quarto YAML box at the top of this document. 
2. Fill in the following sections, completing all requested information inside the `< >`s (but do not leave them afterwards!).
3. Submit a rendered version of this document on Moodle to the [Final Project Submission](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/url/view.php?id=1029245).

Do not leave any of the carets (`< >`) in this document. They are meant to indicate the content I want you to change, not be a part of your final output. If you leave them in, it has the potential to hide your text in the final output. **Make sure you look over your rendered document to assure it is as you expect**. If I cannot tell what you wanted me to look at, I will not go searching.

### Standard Evaluation Request

For each of the following, provide a specific example of the where in your project you think you demonstrated proficiency in the relevant standard. Be sure to describe how you meet the standards *per the description in the [standards table](https://adv-r-programming.github.io/Adv-R-Reader/syllabus/#standards)*. Making up your own definition of what it means to "Exceed standard" will not help you.



For example, [here is a link to exactally Line 13](https://github.com/Adv-R-Programming/Adv-R-Reader/blob/main/content/labs/_index.en.md?plain=1#L13) of the Quarto document that creates the Labs page on the course reader.
