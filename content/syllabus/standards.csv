Coding,Functions,Copies-and-pastes similar code with small changes.,Creates simple functions with predetermined inputs.,Creates functions that that make use of arguments to modify their output.,"Creates functions that can handle novel inputs, with logic and error checking to determine outputs.","Creates functions that can handle arbitrary input through the use of "". . ."" or S3 classes."
Coding,Iteration,Copies-and-pastes similar code several times to repeat identical tasks on different data.,Calls an identical function (even self-made) to repeat a task on different data.,Uses loop style iteration to act on sequences of data.,Uses apply style iteration to act on sequences of data.,Can iterate in parallel and justify the overhead costs.
Coding,Data Structures,"Cannot differentiate between data types (numeric, logical, character, etc.). Uses the wrong type during analyses.",Can subset data from vectors or dataframes by position or condition.,Works with lists when appropriate and can subset list elements effectively by position or condition.,Works with attributes effectively. Can modify and use attributes manipulate or create data structures.,Works with nested lists by inputting and sub-setting programmatically defined arbitrary elements.
Workflow,Code Style,Code style is inconsistent and lacks appropriate comments.,Code comments explain the general purpose of the code file. Indentation is consistent and predictable.,Code comments explain the broad strokes of intended behavior per section. Files make use of the built-in section headings in R Studio.,Comments explain code step-by-step. All dependencies and parameters are clearly provided and explained at the top of code files.,Code includes built in error checking for anticipated problems. These checks will output warnings or stop execution of code.
Workflow,git/Github,Does not use git for version control.,Uses git for version control on individual projects with appropriately sized commits with descriptive commit messages.,Uses git and GitHub for version control on group work with appropriately sized commits with descriptive commit messages.,Effectively creates and merges branches of appropriate size. No sensitive files are committed.,Effectively requests and performs code review on pull requests using GitHub.
Workflow,Project Management,Does not use project management tools.,"Project management is only conducted though messaging, such as on slack.","User the GitHub issue tracker to set milestones, but does not fill out associated metadata such as who is responsible for the issue and when it is due.",Uses the GitHub issue tracker to break down and assign actionable work with all appropriate metadata included.,"Uses projects KanBan boards to break down tasks into actionable steps, and track their completion."
Package,Package Function,Package cannot be installed.,Package does not pass check().,One or more component functions or unit tests of package do not execute.,Package includes and passes all unit tests to ensure expected functionality.,Package passes check() with no warnings.
Package,Package Documentation,Package has no documentation.,Team can create a ReadMe file which explains the overall purpose of the package and its use.,"Package includes help files for all functions, including a definition, expected inputs, outputs, and clear descriptions of arguments.",Vignettes are provided for the major functionalities of the package. Help files include reproducible examples of function usage.,A live website is accessible for the package to share resources and vignettes.
