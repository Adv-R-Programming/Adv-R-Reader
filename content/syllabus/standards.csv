Coding,Iteration,Copies-and-pastes similar code several times to repeat identical tasks on different data.,Calls an identical function (even self-made) to repeat a task on different data.,Uses loop style iteration to act on sequences of data.,Uses apply style iteration to act on sequences of data.,Can iterate in parallel and justify the overhead costs.
Coding,Data Structures,Only works with vectors or dataframes.,,,,
Workflow,Code Style,Code style is inconsistent and lacks appropriate comments.,Code comments explain the general purpose of the code. Indentation is consistent and predictable.,Code comments explain the broad strokes of intended behavior. Files make use of the built-in section headings in R Studio.,Comments explain code step-by-step. All dependencies and parameters are clearly provided and explained at the top of code files.,
