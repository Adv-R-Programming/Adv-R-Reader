Wrangling,Data Importing,Cannot import data or uses R Studio visual tools to import data.,Manually organizes or modifies data before importing it into R.,Can import raw data into R using the appropriate function for the data source.,Can author API calls or use other remote sources and import data directly into R.
Wrangling,Data Cleaning,Cleans data in a non-programmatic way.,Can clean data programmatically on a cell-by-cell basis to prepare it for analysis.,"Can assign the correct common data types (logical, integer, numeric, factor, and string) to loaded data and understand the uses of each. Can clean data for analysis in a vectorized way.","Can prepare data for advanced types (dates, time series, etc.). Can prepare data from non-traditional sources such as OCR or web scraping."
Wrangling,Data Reshaping,Formats data in a non-programmatic way.,Can derive new measures from existing data and append it to dataframes. ,"Can pivot data between wide and long formats, and can explain the use case of each.","Can use lists as stores of arbitrary data structures, and subset/combine the data held within them. For example, can use a list to store iteration output, then later combine them."
Wrangling,Data Aggregation & Subsetting,Transforms data in a non-programmatic way.,Creates multiple copies of data in several intermediate stages of transformation that are used for different steps of analysis.,Can combine and split data sets using the appropriate merge or subset techniques.,Can split or merge data sets using either SQL-like calls (such as the x_join() series of functions) or approximate string matching.
Coding,Functions,Copies-and-pastes similar code with small changes.,Creates simple functions with consistent inputs.,"Creates simple functions that can handle novel inputs, with logic to handle the data appropriately.","Created functions include conditionals and error checking to test for faulty data and describe the issue. Functions can intake multiple forms of data and handle both appropriately. For an example, see the “Make it Flex” section of Lab 5."
Coding,Iteration,Copies-and-pastes similar code several times within or between scripts.,Uses for loops or apply functions to iterate through vector data to preform a single data manipulation.,Can use either loops or apply functions to iterate over a vector of data and preform multi-step manipulations.,Can use loops or apply functions and explain the use cases for each. Can iterate over complex data structures such as dataframes or lists.
Data Visualization,Visualization Structure,Selects inappropriate formats for data visualization.,Selects sub-optimal visualization formats or uses excessive visualizations where a single one would be sufficient.,"Selects suitable formats for data visualization (bar, line, boxplot, etc.) and can explain the reasoning behind that choice.","Effectively mixes visualization formats or isolates individual elements to clearly communicate a message. For example, including a miniature table of the most important values within a bar plot."
Data Visualization,Visualization Aesthetics,Chooses visual cues and colors for purely aesthetic reasons without attention to data representation.,"Data visualizations attempt to represent underlying data, but use methods unsuited to the task which leave ambiguity for the viewer.","Data visualizations use color, scale, and shapes effectively to differentiate and communicate underlying data.","Data visualizations are highly customized with bespoke elements, such as callouts, to clearly communicate the message of the visualization. Aesthetics are sensitive to accessibility concerns."
Data Visualization,Visualization Context,"Produces data visualizations that are unclear, confusing, devoid of context, or impossible to understand without reading the text.","Produces data visualizations with readable axis labels, units, and legends (where appropriate).",Produces data visualizations that are clear and understandable with minimal textual explanation.,Produces data visualizations that are self-contained and can be understood on their own without textual explanation.
Workflow,Data Ethics,Does not consider data ethics or investigate data provenance.,Can articulate common pitfalls and relate them to the project at hand. Confirms data types and scales using data documentation.,Reads data documentation to understand data collection/generation and measurements. Can highlight and explain to readers the potential concerns specific to the data or project.,"Either creates data documentation for used data, or includes notes in code to the data sources and explains potential pitfalls. Considers and articulates relevant concerns related to the current project unprompted throughout the work cycle."
Workflow,Code Style,Code style is inconsistent and/or lacks documentation.,Code comments explain the broad strokes of intended behavior. Indentation is consistent and predictable. Uses print statements to track the status of code execution.,"Consistently comments all code and makes use of the built-in section headings in R Studio. For user created functions, the inputs and outputs are clearly explained, and examples are provided.",Includes “sanity checks” for data validity in code. For longer scripts or iterations includes print statements to track execution progress.
Workflow,Git/Github,Does not use git for version control.,"Uses git and GitHub for version control and can contribute to group repositories with commits, pushes, and pulls.",Uses git and GitHub effectively. Code commits are of appropriate size and commented well. Can branch and merge repositories while resolving any merge conflicts. Does not include sensitive files in commits.,"Uses Github effectively for collaboration. Can create issues, ask for review, and merge branches in a manner suitable for a collaborative environment."
