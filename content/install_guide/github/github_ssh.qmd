## Overview

[Github](https://github.com) is a online code repository that great expands the utility of git. It acts as a clearinghouse for code, and is used worldwide by researchers, government, and industry.

## Create an Account

First up, we need to create an account on [github.com](https://github.com). Navigate to the site, and click the **Sign up** button in the upper right.

Enter your email and create a password.

You will most likely receive an email from Github asking to confirm your account. Go and click that.

## Creating SSH Keys and Adding to Github

Creating a new SSH key will invalidate all the places your current SSH key is used! Do not create a new one if you already have one!

**SSH Keys** are a way to identify your computer when accessing external resources. Think about it like a password for your computer to log in by itself. The first thing we need to do is create an SSH key for your computer. Open up R Studio, and click on the **Terminal** tab in the bottom left pane. Copy the following, enter your correct email, and press enter to create a key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`

Your terminal will look slightly different than my pictures, but the process is the same.

It will ask where you want to save the key. Accept the defaults by pressing **Enter**.

It will then ask you to create a pass phrase, press enter twice to skip this step.

It will then show a printout of your key, and a little bit of art. I've greyed mine out here for security.

Next, type `cd` and press enter, followed by `cat .ssh/id_ed25519.pub`. It will print out a code starting with "ssh-ed25519 ... your_email@smith.edu." You want to highlight all of that, including the "ssh-ed25519" and your email, press CTRL or command + C to copy it.

We will now return to [github.com](https://github.com) and login.

In the upper right hand corner you will see your user profile dropdown. Click on that and go to **Settings**.

On your setting screen, in the left hand menu, click on "SSH and GPG keys."

On the next screen, click the green button in the upper right that says "New SSH Key."

On the following screen, name your key, and paste the text we copied into the "Key" box. Then press the "Add SSH Key" button.

{{% notice info %}}
If you are using multiple terminals (like WSL and git Bash on windows) your SSH keys are **specific** to each of those programs. So, if you make a key in git Bash, then try to push using WSL, *GitHub will not recognize you*. You will need to repeat this process for each terminal you intend to use.
The same is true of the terminals on remote servers!
