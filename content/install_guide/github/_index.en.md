## Overview

[Github][] is a online code repository that great expands the utility of git. It acts as a clearinghouse for code, and is used worldwide by researchers, government, and industry.

## Create an Account

First up, we need to create an account on [github.com][Github]. Navigate to the site, and click the **Sign up** button in the upper right.

![][1]

Enter your email and create a password.

![][2]

You will most likely receive an email from Github asking to confirm your account. Go and click that.

## Creating SSH Keys and Adding to Github

{{% notice warning %}}
Creating a new SSH key will invalidate all the places your current SSH key is used!

**SSH Keys** are a way to identify your computer when accessing external resources. Think about it like a password for your computer to log in by itself. The first thing we need to do is create an SSH key for your computer. Open up R Studio, and click on the **Terminal** tab in the bottom left pane. Copy the following, enter your correct email, and press enter to create a key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`

The terminal will look slightly different in my pictures, but the process is the same in the R Studio terminal.

It will ask where you want to save the key. Accept the defaults by pressing **Enter**.

![][4]

It will then ask you to create a pass phrase, press enter twice to skip this step.

![][5]

It will then show a printout of your key, and a little bit of art. I've greyed mine out here for security.

![][6]

Next, type `cd` and press enter, followed by `cat .ssh/id_ed25519.pub`. It will print out a code starting with "ssh-ed25519 ... your_email@smith.edu." You want to highlight all of that, including the "ssh-ed25519" and your email, press CTRL or command + C to copy it.

![][7]

We will now return to [github.com][Github] and login.

![][8]

In the upper right hand corner you will see your user profile dropdown. Click on that and go to **Settings**.

![][9]

On your setting screen, in the left hand menu, click on "SSH and GPG keys."

![][10]

On the next screen, click the green button in the upper right that says "New SSH Key."

![][11]

On the following screen, name your key, and paste the text we copied into the "Key" box. Then press the "Add SSH Key" button.

![][12]

{{% notice info %}}
If you are using multiple terminals (like WSL and git Bash on windows) your SSH keys are **specific** to each of those programs. So, if you make a key in git Bash, then try to push using WSL, *GitHub will not recognize you*. You will need to repeat this process for each terminal you intend to use.
The same is true of the terminals on remote servers!
