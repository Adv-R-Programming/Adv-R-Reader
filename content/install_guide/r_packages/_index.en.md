## Overview

R uses a number of packages to work with data, which are largely community created. This means many of them do not come pre-installed with R. Here is a list of packages we will use this semester. You should be able to paste this into the R console and press enter to install them all at once.

    install.packages("tidyverse");
    install.packages("dplyr");
    install.packages("todor");
    install.packages("future");
    install.packages("rvest");
    install.packages("RSQLite")
